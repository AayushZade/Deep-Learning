# Linear Regression Model

This project is part of the **Deep-Learning** repository, showcasing a fundamental implementation of a **Linear Regression** model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this project is to model the relationship between variables and use the linear regression technique for prediction tasks.

## Project Overview

Linear regression is a widely-used statistical method to model the relationship between one dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In this notebook, we:

- Load and preprocess data.
- Build and train a linear regression model.
- Visualize the regression line and its relationship to the dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling**: Preprocess data, including missing value imputation and normalization if needed.
- **Model Training**: Fit a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyze performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- **Visualization**: Plot the regression line over the data points for better understanding.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AayushZade/Deep-Learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Deep-Learning
    ```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb
    ```

4. Run all cells to execute the linear regression model.

## Usage

- Replace the dataset in the notebook to apply the linear regression model on your data.
- Tweak model parameters or preprocessing steps to experiment with different approaches.
- Visualize and interpret the regression results using the provided plots.

## Results

The notebook provides:
- A fitted linear regression line visualized over the data points.
- Evaluation metrics such as MSE and R-squared to judge the performance of the model.
