## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to deep learning projects, from simple neural networks to more advanced models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The goal is to provide educational and practical examples that can help developers and researchers learn and experiment with deep learning concepts.

## Projects



*More projects will be added over time.*

## Installation

To run the projects locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AayushZade/Deep-Learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Deep-Learning
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   - Each project may have its own dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the project**:
   - Instructions for running each project will be included in the projectâ€™s specific directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary language used for development.
- **TensorFlow**: A popular deep learning framework for building neural networks.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **PyTorch** (for some projects): An open-source machine learning framework.
- **NumPy, Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.
